----------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.85 - 0.86

  - *** added flac support ***
  - pause resume bug fixed

    rather than 10%.
  - rating selection box should work right now.
  - fixed equalizer, which had numerous problems in both
    the front end and back end.

    an integrated version of projectm soon.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.82 - 0.85

  - obselete features removed, including prompting to
    save a modified std playlist.

    less bugs.
  - migration to taglib. means more speed and stability

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.8 - 0.82

  - should fix strange crashes while threads are active. this includes
    during adding/removing songs, retagging, and renaming files. this
    was caused by update events being called from a thread without a
    mutex.
  - ctrl + alt + shift + page up = previous album from current artist
  - ctrl + alt + shift + page down = next album from current artist
  - ctrl + alt + page up = previous artist
  - ctrl + alt + page down = next artist
  - balloon tips now shown when volume hotkeys are used
  - new tray icon behavior. if tray icon is enabled, it will
    always be visible. a single click to the tray icon
    restores the window if it is hidden, or hides the window
    if it is visible.
  - new global hotkeys:
      * ctrl + alt + up arrow     :  play/resume
      * ctrl + alt + down arrow   :  pause
      * ctrl + alt + left arrow   :  previous track
      * ctrl + alt + right arrow  :  next track
      * windows key + up arrow    :  volume up
      * windows key + down arrow  :  volume down
  - libxine support for linux and musikBox.
  - balloon tips when using system tray. can be toggled off in
    the preferences
  - page fault ratio drastically reduced
  - huge cleanup of musikCore::Player. the strange crossfade bug
    should now be gone now. (jared?)
  ** posted cvs: musikCube_10092004.exe
  - the font for rating songs should install properly now
  - various small bug fixes
  - multimedia keyboard support
  - rewrote musikCore::Player to act as a virtual class. This means a developer
    can now easily plug in his own sound system by overriding a few virtual
    functions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.7 - 0.75

  - musikCore and musikBox will now share a common directory and
    library (preferences will be stored in separate files). This
    means settings will now be stored in
    c:\docs and settings\user\.musikproject instead of
    c:\docs and settings\user\.musikCube or .musikBox
  - fixed possible segfault on exit
  - default equalizer is no longer reset every time musikCore::Library
    is initialized (i.e., at the start of the program)
  - if a song was paused and "prev" was pressed, it would remain paused

  - the currently playing song can be rated from the tray popup menu
  - songs can be rated -1 now (will be useful for the upcoming autodj)
  - can now right click a group of selected songs in the playlist
  - times stored in the database are now julian dates, so they can be used
    extremely easily in dynamic playlist queries. example dynamic playlist
    "lastplayed > julianday('now','-2 days')" to show all songs played
    within the last two days.
  - selection boxes and playlist now correctly update when playback stops
  - 'actions' button in the now playing panel (next to play/pause/next) that
    allows the user to generate random playlists very quickly.

    clicking, and selecting the "Tag" menu. Check the preferences for
    setting up auto capitalization keywords.
  - musikCore::TaskQueue added to handle tasks independant from
    the front end.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a6/6.1/6.1.1/0.6.1.2:

  - netstream metainfo is now put into the currently-playing song fields for
    artist and title, so UI and tunage can now show what is playing in the

  ***********************************************************************

  - Fixed a weird bug that may have allowed playlists to get saved
    incorrectly.
  - Prefs -> Interface -> General is now Prefs -> Interface -> Workflow
  - Currently playing item in "Now Playing" is no longer bold. The
    little playback icon is enough.
  - A preference for old-style double clicking song behavior.
  - "Sub Libraries" (name subject to change) now available. they
    are stored as standard playlists, but displayed differently.
    each "Sub Library" is a pseudo library created dynamically,
    based on playlist content.
  - fixed the EXTREMELY annoying pause / resume bug thats been
    plaguing me for ages.
  - optimized memory management of CmusikPlaylists in the UI
  - fixed a couple instances of the playlist and/or selection
    boxes being updated twice. the ui should be faster now.
  - fixed some unnecessary and potentially dangerous pointer
    dereferencing in musikCore::Player
  - fixed a memory leak and potential crash relating to clearing
    the library.
  - fixed a bug where adding synchronized paths with spaces
    could cause a "conflicting path" error.
  - fixed a bug where dropping from sources without a playlist
    would not start playback

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

a2:

  - much improved navigation. double clicking a song adds it
    to the now playing queue. it is played in the background
    until either another song is clicked or it expires. also
    dropping files onto now playing not only queues the songs
    but starts playback if not playing.
  - fixed a bug where clearing the now playing and clicking
    a column to sort would crash
  - the playlist now has an icon to indicate if a song is
    playing or not.
  - bug where hiding selection boxes and reshowing would
    scramble sizes
  - crossfader presets and settings are now available to
    the user. see file -> preferences -> sound -> crossfader
  - duplicate equalizer and crossfader preset names are
    no longer allowed. this keeps stuff a lot easier
    to maintain in the backend.
  - lots of internal cleaning for musikCore's musikCore::Playlist
  - redid the equalizer presets dialog.
  - fixed tab ordering in all dialogs
  - added "Shuffle Now Playing" to playlist context menu
  - "Shuffle Now Playing" menu option disabled if now playing
    playlist is empty.
  - changed "Standard Playlists" to "Playlists" in the
    sources panel
  - fixes a bug where parenting a box, selecting nothing,
    then selecting an item from another box would
    not reparent
  - playlists are now stored as filenames, not ids.
  - memory leak when prompting to save playlist.
  - fixed sources drag and drop from standard playlists
  - disallow any undesirable drag and drop activity
  - playlist drag and dropping crash when not playing
  - from selection boxes -> playlist drag and drop bug fix
  - CTRL + A / CTRL + D in playlist to select and deslect
    all the items
  - much better theme support
  - changed rollover button behavior for playback
    buttons
  - fixed the problem with the rating selection boxes
  - dustin's bug with shuffling then drag and dropping

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

a1: January 25, 2004, 2:15 AM

don't expect another build for a few weeks. please
stress test this build if at all possible. see if you
can confuse it into crashing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   what we've been up to since wxMusik 0.2.1 CVS: a quick ramble

      musik, up to version 0.2.1, was not ment or developed
      to be an extremely usable, stable product. it was a
      concept to test various aspects of creating an
      extremely easy and powerful audio library and player.

      we came to one conclusion after almost a year of
      development and two, maybe three of planning:
      the backend and the frontend must exist separate.

      the backend would be completely independant
      of any gui. why?

          - no cross platform gui toolkit offered
            quite the flexability we wanted.

          - because the core contains no gui, it could be
            nearly complete ANSI C++, as long as we chose
            the right libraries to use for helpers (threads,
            sql access, etc).

          - to limit overhead

          - not only could we easily use the core to make
            our own mp3 player, but so could others

       platforms we support:

          - supported:

            windows nt 4.0,
            windows 2000
            windows xp
            linux with oss and alsa

          - unsupported:

             windows 95
             windows 98
             windows me.

             from our personal experience dustin and i believe
             the preceding versions of windows to be inherently
             unstable.

             musik will probably run on these platforms, but is
             not officially supported, meaning we may help you,
             we may not. sorry. :(

       whats new with the windows gui?

           - completely redesigned interface. moved from wxWindows to
             mfc, using limited overhead while still sporting a lot
             of features. oh yeah -- and its fast. really fast.

           - minimal cpu and memory usage making it very lightweight.

           - dockable panels (everyone should be excited)

           - automatic saving and loading of equalizer presets
             on a per song basis or through the preset manager.

           - crossfader is more accurate than ever before, and
             now has its own preset manager (dialog not
             implemented yet).

           - gui workflow has been extremely optimized with the new
             "Now Playing" sources entry.

       and whats new with the linux gui?

           - musikBox, written with Gtkmm. See http://www.musikcube.com
