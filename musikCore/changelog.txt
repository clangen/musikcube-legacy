- Testing write access
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

a6.2-:

  - Netstream fix. Streams ending in .ogg and .mp3 are now handled
    correctly.
  - New musikCore::BatchChgCase and musikCore::BatchChgCaseThread
    to do batch case changes on tags.
  - FMOD upgraded to 3.72. Optionally, FMOD 3.71 can also be used,
    check the #define in musikConfig.h
  - musikCore::TaskQueue added and implemented in musikCore::Library.
    This should take away any problems or issues interfaces may have 
    with queuing their own threads. Any number of instances of this
    object may exist for any purpose, and will act independantly of
    one another.
  - musik:: namespace renamed musikCore::
  - netstreams are no longer purged on synchronization.
